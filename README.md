# pytest-report-diff
This is create to diff the report generated by pytest-html. Basically, it's for one of the project in my company. I don't know if it is of any usefulness. However, feel free to contact me for this small program.


# Installation
You should be able to just install the requirement.txt by pip.
The program would work for you immediately.

However, if you encounter lxml installation issue,
you might want to try the following steps:

for python 3:


```bash
    sudo apt-get install python3 python-dev python3-dev \
            build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev \
            libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev \
            python-pip
```

for python 2:

```bash
    sudo apt-get install python-dev  \
         build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev \
         libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev \
         python-pip
```
